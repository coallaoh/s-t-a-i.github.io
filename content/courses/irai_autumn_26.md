This course teaches that path, from the inverted index of the 1970s to the research agents of 2026. Half the assigned papers were published in the last eighteen months, and one of them has no venue yet. The framing is information retrieval for AI, not AI for information retrieval. Classical retrieval is the toolkit rather than the subject, and BM25 earns its place not as history but because dense retrievers still lose to it out of domain. Monday is a lecture on the method. Wednesday is a structured discussion of a research paper that uses it. Alongside both, the class builds its own document collection, writes its own queries, judges relevance by hand, and measures a retrieval system against the judgements it produced itself."

**In one line.** Mondays are lectures, Wednesdays are structured paper discussions in fixed groups of five, and the only weekly deadline is a half-page written review due Tuesday at 18:00. Four hours a week, two of them contact time. No exam.

## 1. Goal

By December, students will be able to:

1. Place a retrieval method on the spectrum from sparse to dense, and say when BM25 still beats it.
2. Say where an AI system's knowledge sits when it runs, and what that choice costs.
3. Build a test collection, and state what nDCG measures and what it hides.
4. Find where a fluent, correct-sounding account of a paper is subtly wrong.
5. Report from their own records where language models fail on research reading.
6. Diagnose why a change to a retrieval system did or did not help.
7. Defend a technical position under challenge, and change it when given a reason.

Objectives 4, 5 and 7 matter most. Few students will ever build a search engine. All of them will read papers whose claims outrun their evidence, work with models that are fluent and wrong, and have to defend a position in a room.

{{< details "The two threads that run through the term" >}}

**From sparse to dense.** TF-IDF, BM25, learned sparse retrieval, bi-encoders, late interaction. A spectrum, not a succession.

**Where knowledge sits when the system runs.** One figure, redrawn every few weeks.

| Regime | Mechanism | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Parametric | All knowledge in weights, fixed compute | A dense LLM |
| Conditionally parametric, by compute | A router selects which parameters to run | Mixture of experts |
| Conditionally parametric, by lookup | A hash selects which parameters to read | Product-key memory, memory layers, Engram |
| Written at inference | The memory is learned while the model runs | Titans, cartridges, sparse memory finetuning |
| Semi-parametric | An index wired into the forward pass | kNN-LM, RETRO, memory networks |
| Non-parametric | A corpus placed into the prompt | Retrieval-augmented generation |
| Open world | A policy decides what to fetch | Search agents, deep research |

The course opens with attention itself as retrieval over the context, so the whole spectrum reads as one idea at different scales.

The middle three rows are where the figure changed in 2026. Routing computation and routing a lookup used to be one row, until a result that year found them complementary rather than alternative, with an optimum between them. The row above them did not exist at all.

{{< /details >}}

## 2. Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch coding.
- Working knowledge of transformers and standard deep learning.
- Basic maths: linear algebra, probability, statistics.
- No prior background in information retrieval is required, and none is expected. The classical material in September will be the new material for most of this audience.

## 3. How the course runs

**The first four weeks are lectures only.** Discussion sessions begin on 30 September, once groups are formed and there is enough retrieval background to argue about a paper rather than decode it.

**Monday** is a lecture on the method. 45 minutes of content, 10 minutes of questions, 5 minutes on the following Wednesday.

**Wednesday** is a discussion of a research paper that uses it, in fixed groups of five. Four Wednesdays are lectures instead, and so are the first three.

**The only weekly deadline is Tuesday 18:00**, when you submit a half-page written review of the assigned paper.

| When | What | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Thu-Sun | Read the assigned paper properly | 1.2 h |
| Mon 09:00-10:00 | The lecture teaching the method | 1 h |
| Mon evening | Consult the supporting paper, run the model check | 30 min |
| Tue | Write the half-page review, submit by 18:00 | 20 min |
| Wed 09:00-10:00 | The session | 1 h |

**Four hours a week, two of them contact time.** There is no project work in a normal week. Three weeks are heavier - sessions 9, 19 and 29 add about two hours each.

{{< details "Groups and roles" >}}

Students are divided into fixed discussion groups of five, held all semester. Each member takes a different role for the week, and roles rotate. Every student holds each role at least once over the term.

| Role | The job | Your supporting paper must |
|---|---|---|
| Adversary | Attack the experiments, find the missing baseline | Make a claim which, if true, weakens the assigned paper's central claim |
| Historian | What came before, and what this paper quietly discards | Predate the assigned paper, and be one it builds on or reacts to |
| Replicator | Check that the numbers support the claims, and measure something | Report numbers for the assigned method that its own authors did not produce |
| Referee | On a paper too new to have been reproduced: would you accept it? | Not apply - the document is the paper's public review thread, or none exists |
| Extender | Propose the next paper and say what it would test | Postdate the assigned paper and build on it |
| Applier | Would you deploy this, at what index size, latency and cost | Contain at least one quantitative resource number from a real deployment |

**You choose your own supporting paper.** Nobody assigns it. Recommendations are published for every role on every assigned paper, and taking one costs you nothing - the course pays for what you do with the paper, not for the effort of finding it. The full rules are below.

**There are five roles, not six.** On the four assigned papers published in the last eighteen months - sessions 15, 21, 25 and 27 - the Replicator becomes the Referee, because no reproduction study exists for a paper that new. The role keeps the same question - should this be believed - and changes the evidence. Where the paper has a public review thread, you read what four reviewers decided and compare it with what your group decided. Where it does not, you write the first review yourself.

Sessions 15 and 27 have threads. Session 21 does not, so the Referee reads the reviews of the *contradicting* paper as a worked example and then reviews the anchor cold. Session 25 has neither, and that Referee writes a review with no model to follow at all.

Note-taking is a duty rather than a role. Rotate it inside the group.

Everyone reads the assigned paper closely. Each student additionally consults one supporting paper chosen for their role - the abstract, the relevant table, the part bearing on their role. The supporting paper belongs to the role, not the group, so all students holding a role in a given week read the same one. They do not coordinate, and there is no joint deliverable.

One Wednesday therefore puts six papers into circulation: the assigned paper, read by everyone, and five supporting papers.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "The weekly written review, and its four fields" >}}

**One review per student, half a page, due 18:00 on Tuesday.** That is the entire weekly obligation outside class.

**1. Model check.** Give a language model the assigned paper and the prompt for your role. Name the model and version, paste its answer in two or three lines, then say what it got wrong or missed.

| Role | Prompt |
|---|---|
| Adversary | "What are the three weakest points in this paper's experimental evidence?" |
| Historian | "What prior work does this build on, and what does it discard from that work?" |
| Replicator | "Do the numbers in the results tables support the claim in the abstract? What would I need to rerun this?" |
| Referee | "Write the four weakest points a conference reviewer would raise about this paper, and give it a score out of 10 with reasons." |
| Extender | "What experiment should come next, and what would it settle?" |
| Applier | "What would it cost to deploy this - index size, latency, serving?" |

**2. What you found, in your role this week.** The substantive point, and what would be needed to believe or refute it. This is the bulk of the page.

**3. A class-local hook.** One sentence tying the paper to something only a class member knows.

**4. One question for the class.** Something you cannot answer from the paper. Three are chosen to open Wednesday.

The half-page cap is deliberate. It holds the weekly load down and forces you to pick your best point rather than list five.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "The Wednesday hour, minute by minute" >}}

| Time | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0-5 | Framing of the assigned paper, this week's ranking criterion, three student questions |
| 5-22 | Discussion groups. Table the five points, rank them, file a written conclusion |
| 22-40 | Open challenge. Groups defend their conclusions against each other |
| 40-58 | Synthesis, corrections, and placement on the knowledge-location spectrum |
| 58-60 | End-of-session questions, answered individually |

The 17 minutes in groups are not open discussion. There is one forced decision and a deadline.

| | Task |
|---|---|
| 5 min | Table the five points, one minute each, in role order. State your point in one sentence, give your evidence, stop. No interruptions until all five have spoken |
| 8 min | Rank the five points against this week's criterion. The group must converge on one ranking |
| 4 min | File the written conclusion by minute 22. Whatever is written at 22:00 is what gets challenged |

**The written conclusion is four lines.**

1. The strongest point in the group this week, and which role brought it.
2. What would settle it - the experiment, the number, the missing baseline.
3. Does the paper survive? Yes / yes with caveats / no.
4. Where it sits on the knowledge-location spectrum, in one phrase.

**The ranking criterion is announced at 9:00 and varies weekly.** Examples: which point most threatens the central claim; which would most change whether you would use this method; which would the authors find hardest to answer; which will still matter in five years; which would you spend a week testing.

**During the open challenge, the member who answers is named at the moment the group is called.** Every member must therefore be able to defend the group's conclusion. There are no prepared presentations of the assigned paper. Everyone has read it, and a summary would waste eight minutes of sixty.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "End-of-session questions" >}}

Three questions, answered individually in the last two minutes.

1. Which role's point won in your group?
2. Name one point that was dropped, and why it lost.
3. What did you walk in believing was strongest? Did that change, and what changed it?

Question 2 can only be answered by someone who followed the argument. You read one supporting paper; the other four reach you only through the discussion. Question 3 is the only place the course pays for changing your mind.

Wednesday sessions are not recorded, so that criticism stays candid. Monday lectures are recorded.

## 5. The class test collection and the project

> You are given a BM25 baseline over the class collection, an evaluation harness, and the class relevance judgements. **Make one change to the retrieval pipeline.** Predict its effect before you write any code. Measure it. Explain the gap between what you predicted and what happened.

| Fixed | Yours to change |
|---|---|
| The collection, the relevance judgements, the metrics, the harness | Anything between the query and the ranked list |

**Compute is a laptop.** Fifty documents and sixty queries. Encoding with a small sentence transformer takes seconds on Colab's free CPU tier, and ColBERT inference over 48 documents runs on CPU. No compute credits are needed and no paid account is required, including for the weekly model check.

{{< details "Why the class builds its own test collection" >}}

To say that system A beats system B, you must know which documents are relevant for a set of queries. That list is a test collection, and a human made it by hand. Every number in every retrieval paper rests on one.

Most students read "nDCG 0.43" as a measurement. It is not. It is the output of a chain of human decisions about what counts as relevant, and you only see that by making those decisions.

The collection is built from the papers the class has read - about 48 documents by December. You cannot judge relevance for documents you do not understand, so a public benchmark in an unfamiliar domain would produce guesses rather than disagreements worth studying.

**What a query looks like matters.**

| Query | What happens |
|---|---|
| "ColBERT" | Bad. The relevant documents are obvious, everyone agrees, nothing is learned |
| "methods whose reported gains came from better training rather than better architecture" | Good. Judging requires reading and thinking, and reasonable people disagree at the borders |

At least one conceptual query per student is required.

The numbers work out at roughly 60 queries, 480 query-document pairs, and two judges per pair, which is about 32 judgements each - some 15 minutes of work. Two judges per pair is what makes agreement measurable. Expect agreement to be low, and treat that as the finding rather than the failure.

At 48 documents the metrics are noisy and rankings will flip on reruns. That is also part of the lesson.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "The modification menu and what you hand in" >}}

Groups claim one modification each at session 9, so that no two duplicate.

- Hybrid BM25 and dense retrieval, fused with reciprocal rank fusion
- A different bi-encoder checkpoint
- doc2query expansion over the collection
- An LLM reranker over the top ten
- Chunking papers into sections instead of indexing whole documents
- ColBERT late interaction

**Deliverables.** A run file (`query_id, doc_id, rank, score`), a one-page write-up due a week before session 29, and an eight-minute presentation.

**The relevance judgements freeze at session 19.** Groups may keep refining afterwards, and should report both their session-19 number and any later one.

{{< /details >}}

## 6. Assessment

| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Weekly paper reviews | 45% |
| End-of-session questions | 20% |
| Contribution to discussion | 10% |
| Project | 25% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

There is no exam and there are no quizzes.

**Two participation requirements**: writing queries, and completing your relevance judgements. More than two missed obligations across the term drops the final grade by one band.

**A student who does all of the work competently lands in the middle of the distribution, not at the top.** Grades are assigned by ranking the class and cutting bands, with a target of roughly even distribution across A+, A0, A-, B+ and B0. This is stated here rather than discovered in December.

{{< details "Weekly paper reviews, 45%" >}}

Eight reviews, one per discussion session. A random four are marked on the scale below and the rest on completion. You will not know in advance which count.

| Score | What it means |
|---|---|
| 4 | Found something real that changes how the paper should be read, or a model failure new to the class record |
| 3 | A substantive point the model check did not already contain |
| 2 | Competent, correct, adequate. The expected mark |
| 1 | Thin, or restates the model's output |
| 0 | Missing, fabricated numbers, or undeclared model use |

Note that "did the work adequately" is a 2, not a 4.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "End-of-session questions, 20%" >}}

Eight sets of three questions, scored against your group's filed conclusion. Question 1 and question 3 are checked mechanically. Question 2 passes if it names a point actually raised in your group.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Contribution to discussion, 10%" >}}

Scored 0-2 whenever you are named to speak in plenary, either to defend your group's conclusion or to answer a question during synthesis. Opportunities are tracked and allocated so that every student is called roughly three times.

| Score | For |
|---|---|
| 2 | Answered the question actually asked, with a reason, and either held up under the follow-up or conceded cleanly |
| 1 | Answered, but restated the conclusion or your own review without engaging the challenge |
| 0 | Could not answer, or absent |

Marks go to the response to challenge. Not to fluency, and not to being right.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Project, 25%" >}}

Scored out of 10, then adjusted by peer evaluation within the group.

| Points | For |
|---|---|
| 0-3 | **The prediction.** Specific and falsifiable? "It will help" scores 0. "nDCG@10 rises about 0.03, because doc2query adds vocabulary our queries actually use" scores 3 |
| 0-3 | **The measurement.** Did it run? Is the comparison fair - same judgements, same metric, baseline re-run rather than quoted? Is every number reproducible from the submitted run file? |
| 0-3 | **The diagnosis.** Why did the result differ from the prediction? A wrong prediction correctly diagnosed scores 3. A right prediction with no explanation scores 1 |
| 0-1 | **Beating the baseline.** One point. That is all |

Position on the leaderboard is worth 10% of the project mark and 2.5% of the final grade. This is deliberate. A modification that made things worse, correctly diagnosed against a wrong prediction, outscores one that helped by accident.

**If your modification does not run**, you can still score on prediction and diagnosis - up to 6 of 10 - provided you submit an honest account of what broke. Only the measurement points are lost.

**Peer evaluation.** Each member distributes 100 points across all five members, including themselves. The mean of what the other four give you becomes a multiplier between 0.85 and 1.15.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "What each grade looks like" >}}

| Grade | Profile |
|---|---|
| A+ | Reviews that found something real more than once. A project that beat the baseline for a defensible reason |
| A0 | Consistently sharp reviews, holds up when called on, strong project |
| A- | Good work throughout, one or two standout contributions |
| B+ | All the work done competently. Nothing missing, nothing exceptional |
| B0 | Work done but thin in places |
| B- | Repeated gaps, or reviews showing the paper was not read |
| F | Non-participation |

{{< /details >}}

## 7. Generative AI policy

**Use is expected, declared and marked.** The course does not defend against it. Detection does not work, and a ban would be absurd in a course about retrieval-augmented systems.

**Credit begins above what a model gives you.** Everything a model produces is free, so a review that restates the model's output scores low even when it is correct. A 3 requires a point the model check did not already contain. This removes any incentive to conceal.

**The bright line: any number in a submitted review must be reproducible from a submitted log.** Fabrication scores zero on that review, no argument. This is not an AI rule. It is the research norm, and it would have applied in 1996.

Undeclared model use scores zero on that submission.

{{< details "The class record of model failures" >}}

The weekly model check is where the policy becomes concrete. Each role's task needs a capability that is weak in a different way.

| What you ask for | What tends to come back |
|---|---|
| Ten objections to this paper | Fluent objections that dissolve on contact. The skill is triage |
| The paper's lineage | Hallucinated citations |
| A rerun script | Code that runs and computes the wrong thing |
| Next experiments | Generic, hedged, unfalsifiable proposals |
| Index size and cost | Confident bad arithmetic |

Every review contributes one line to a class record of model failures - model, version, paper type, failure observed, how it was caught. It is reviewed at sessions 19 and 29. The interesting question is which failures disappear as models improve during the term, and nobody knows that in advance.

The instructor prepares lecture material with model assistance and adds the model's mistakes to the same record.

## 8. Reading list

| # | Session | Paper |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 11 (14 Oct) | Yang, Lu & Lin (2019), *Critically Examining the "Neural Hype"* (SIGIR) |
| 2 | 8 (30 Sep) | Thakur et al. (2021), *BEIR* (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks) |
| 3 | 13 (21 Oct) | Khattab & Zaharia (2020), *ColBERT* (SIGIR) |
| 4 | 15 (28 Oct) | Su et al. (2025), *BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval* (ICLR) |
| 5 | 17 (4 Nov) | Chun et al. (2021), *Probabilistic Embeddings for Cross-Modal Retrieval* (CVPR) |
| 6 | 21 (18 Nov) | Cheng et al. (2026), *Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models* - the Engram paper |
| 7 | 25 (2 Dec) | Jin et al. (2025), *Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning* (COLM) |
| 8 | 27 (9 Dec) | Hu, Wang & McAuley (2026), *Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions* (ICLR) |

**Four of the eight were published in the last eighteen months, and that is the point.** An earlier draft of this course required every assigned paper to be two to six years old, so that a real contradicting paper, a real predecessor and a reproduction all existed. That rule produces a tidy syllabus about a field that has moved on. It is gone. Sessions 21 and 27 assign work whose lineage is still being written, and part of the exercise is judging a paper without the safety of a literature that has already judged it.

Four notes on the choices.

- **Session 8 opens the discussion series**, four weeks in. BEIR goes first because it launches the judging protocol that workshop 1 needs two days later.
- **Sessions 8 and 15** are the same finding five years apart. BEIR reports that BM25 beats dense retrievers out of domain; BRIGHT reports that they lose again once the query needs reasoning. Nobody is told in advance that these are related.
- **Session 11 puts "your baselines were weak" after the class has built a test collection by hand.** Reading that argument having just felt how arbitrary a relevance judgement is hits differently from reading it in week two.
- **Session 17** is the instructor's own paper, deliberately. Six students attacking it in front of the author settles the question of whether criticism is welcome.
- **Session 27** closes the loop to session 4 with 2026 material. A benchmark finds that no memory method masters all four competencies it defines; the adversary's paper then finds that swapping only the embedding model flips which method wins.

{{< details "Choosing your supporting paper: the rules" >}}

Supporting papers are not assigned. Each week you hold one role and you choose the paper that serves it.

**Every role, every week.**

1. **Declare it.** Your review opens with one line before the four fields: *Supporting paper:* author, year, title, venue, URL or DOI. *Why it fits the role:* one sentence. No declaration line is marked as if no supporting paper was read.
2. **Choose by Tuesday 18:00.** No approval step, no earlier deadline. The review is the moment of choice.
3. **It must be checkable.** A DOI, an arXiv id, or a stable URL.
4. **One paper.** If you read more, declare the one you rely on.
5. **Not the assigned paper, and not another of the eight.** Everyone reads those already.
6. **No reuse.** A paper declared in an earlier week cannot be declared again, in any role.
7. **Duplicates between students are fine.** No coordination required, no penalty.
8. **Papers only**, with two exceptions: blog posts, documentation, code and review threads are admissible for Applier and Referee, where the artefact type is the point.
9. **English, or translate** the passage you rely on.
10. **Authorship is not a bar.** A later paper by the assigned paper's own authors is often the right Extender choice.
11. **If nothing fits, take the recommendation and say why** - one sentence on what you searched for and why it failed. **This scores 2.** An honest failed search is a result.

**What full marks require, by role.**

| Role | Your review must contain |
|---|---|
| Adversary | The specific claim under attack, quoted or cited to its table. The contrary evidence and the number it rests on. What would settle it. Whether the paper survives, and on what conditions |
| Historian | What the paper took. **What it discarded** - the harder half. Whether discarding it was justified |
| Replicator | One number from the assigned paper, its counterpart in yours, the size and direction of the discrepancy, and its most likely cause |
| Referee | Your own verdict written **before** opening the thread - accept, reject or major revision, three reasons, a score out of 10. Then one thing the reviewers caught that you missed, and one you caught that they missed |
| Extender | What the successor kept and changed. The experiment neither has run. What that experiment would settle. "Test it at larger scale" scores 1 |
| Applier | The deployment scale you are costing, an estimate with the arithmetic shown, the binding constraint, and whether you would deploy it |

**How the choice is marked.** It gates the review score rather than carrying its own. A paper that fails its role test caps the review at **1**, however good the writing. A paper that passes with the actions missing caps it at **2**. Above that the normal scale applies.

**A case these rules do not cover is resolved in your favour for that week**, and the rules are amended before the next session. Raise it on Slack so the answer reaches everyone.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Recommended supporting papers" >}}

These are recommendations, not assignments. Each is a safe choice that passes its role's test, and taking one carries no advantage and no penalty. The rest are published with the roster two weeks before each session.

Session 9 will produce low agreement between judges, and these explain why that is a result rather than a failure.

- **Voorhees (2000), *Variations in relevance judgments and the measurement of retrieval effectiveness*** (IP&M). Required. TREC's own finding that judges disagree substantially yet system rankings stay stable.
- Zobel (1998), *How Reliable Are the Results of Large-Scale IR Experiments?* (SIGIR).
- Buckley & Voorhees (2004), *Retrieval Evaluation with Incomplete Information* (SIGIR).

**Commercial search.** Shah & Bender (2022) *Situating Search* (CHIIR), the strongest case against replacing search with language models, and worth reading precisely because this course argues the other way; Google's *How Search Works*, read critically as a primary source.

**Scholarly search and literature synthesis.** Lo et al. (2020) *S2ORC* (ACL); Swanson (1986) on literature-based discovery; Wang et al. (2024) *SciMON* (ACL); Asai et al. (2024) *OpenScholar*; Skarlinski et al. (2024) *PaperQA2*. This block lost its own lecture in the 2026 revision and is now read alongside session 24, because deep research and literature synthesis are the same problem.

## 9. Logistics

**Language:** English

**Lecturer:** [Seong Joon Oh](/#members)

**Tutors:** To be announced.

**When:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 09:00-10:00. Sessions 9, 19 and 29 run 09:00-10:30.

**Where:** Online (Zoom), for every session. Joining details are circulated by email before the first session. Cameras are required in discussion groups and optional in plenary.

The course registration system lists a classroom at 양재산학캠퍼스 against both slots. **That room is not used.** Do not go there.

**Enrolment:** Capped at 40.

**Email:** `coallaoh@stai-lab.org` for submissions, questions, and feedback.

**Slack:** The course workspace carries announcements, the weekly roster, and questions. [Join here](https://join.slack.com/t/irai2026/shared_invite/zt-469u9zuz7-mMki5OXgvpkOKAsidUITHw).

**A note on time zones.** The Wednesday session cannot be missed and is not recorded. If 09:00 KST is unreasonable where you are, say so on the first-day survey, before groups are formed.
